* Description
This layer does wonderful things:
  - This is a fix for a bug in the =search-engine= layer of "Spacemacs".
  - In addition, =migemo= is made available for narrowing down using =helm=. The Japanese are delighted :-)
** Supported search engines
  - Same as =search-engine= layer

* Install
Place the =img= directory and the three files =README.org=, =funcs.el=, and =packages.el= in
=~/.emacs.d/private/search-engine-revision= directory.
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =search-engine-revision= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this file.
In addition, it is necessary to be able to use =migemo=, such as introducing the =japanese= layer.
For example [[https://github.com/kenjimyzk/spacemacs-japanese][kenjimyzk/spacemacs-japanese]].

* Key bindings

| Evil      | Holy    | Command                                   |
|-----------+---------+-------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC a /~ | ~C-c /~ | Summon a Helm buffer to select any engine |

* Customize it!

In the =search-engine= layer, it was not possible to add a new search engine :-(
Also if you want more search engines, just push them (do this in =dotspacemacs/user-config=)
